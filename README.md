# SE2832 Lab 1 Triangle Trouble
## Introduction
Telly loves triangles. At least he does on Sesame Street. However, have you ever thought of how to go about determining if a set of numbers defines a valid triangle?

In this exercise, you are going to work with a lab partner to test and verify a piece of software. The software reads in a file which defines triangles and prints out whether the line defines a valid triangle or not and what type of triangle it is.

## Lab Objectives
* Generate test cases for a problem.
* Write accurate and complete defect reports
* Enter defect reports into a mock defect tracking tool
* Define test cases that verify that a defect has been fixed.
* Correct defects in software
