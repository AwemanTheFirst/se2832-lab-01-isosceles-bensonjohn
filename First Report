The program has marked every triangle valid, which is certainly not the case.
If any of the requirements are not met, then the triangle should be considered invalid.
There does not seem to be any handling for when sides have a length of zero or a negative length.
Also, the it does not handle when any one side is as long or longer than the sum of the other two.
